# Coding standards

These rules apply to the Rust code in this repository and use RFC 2119 keywords.

Use the `rust-skills` and `code-refinements` skills when writing, reviewing, or refactoring Rust code.

## Types

Configuration fields and other domain values MUST use semantic types (e.g. `HttpPort`, `HttpStatusCode`), not bare primitives. Type aliases are the minimum; use newtypes when compiler-enforced distinctions or invariants are needed.

Domain types MUST make illegal states unrepresentable. Code MUST parse external values into semantic types that preserve their invariants ("parse, don't validate"). Public constructors and deserialization MUST enforce those invariants so callers cannot construct invalid values. Once parsed, downstream code MUST rely on the type rather than repeat validation.

All units of measurement MUST use distinct semantic newtypes (e.g. `Bytes`, `Seconds`, `Milliseconds`), not bare primitives or type aliases. Measurement types MUST keep their representation private so callers cannot construct invalid quantities or mix units implicitly. Unit conversions MUST be explicit and typed.

## Panics

Rust code MUST NOT panic. Agents MUST NOT use `unwrap`, `expect`, `panic!`, `todo!`, or `unreachable!`.

## Errors

Fallible operations MUST return `Result` and use `?` to propagate errors.

## Async runtime

Async subsystems SHOULD share the application's runtime. The composition root MUST enable the drivers required by its subsystems and propagate runtime-creation failures as typed `Result` errors. Subsystem APIs MAY assume this configured application context. Supporting arbitrary externally configured runtimes requires a separate explicit requirement.

## Imports

Agents SHOULD import types, traits, and constants freely. Agents SHOULD be more conservative about importing free functions and SHOULD import a free function only when the file uses it repeatedly. A function used once stays qualified with its module path.

```rust
use hex::FromHexError;

fn parse(input: &str) -> Result<Vec<u8>, FromHexError> {
    let bytes = hex::decode(input)?;
    // ...
    Ok(bytes)
}
```

## File structure

Files MUST start with the most important definitions: public types, their impls, and public functions. Private items follow, so the file reads from most important to least important.

## Test compilation

Rust production code under crate-local `src/` MUST NOT use `#[cfg(not(test))]`. `#[cfg(test)]` is permitted under `src/` ONLY on module declarations that load mirrored crate-local `unit-tests/` modules through the required relative `#[path]`.

Production implementations MUST be the same in test and non-test builds. Test-only helpers MUST live in `unit-tests/`, not `src/`. Equivalent test-dependent `cfg`, `cfg_attr`, or `cfg!` forms MUST NOT bypass this rule.

Code reviews MUST explicitly verify compliance.

## Comments

Comments MUST explain what the code does not make obvious and MUST NOT restate signatures or logic. Comments explaining non-obvious constructs (e.g., concurrency or lifecycle issues) to a Rust advanced-beginner are encouraged (assume expertise in Scala).
Public API documentation MUST state concise contracts, observable behavior, and error conditions. Explanations of Rust mechanics for an advanced beginner belong in inline comments, not API documentation.
